This will be a simple web application that quizes users on players listed on projected opening day lineups for the 2023 MLB season. 

- I ran into some problems scraping player names initially because the websites I looked at first had complicated html, but I eventually found one that worked.
- Got picture scraper to work and insert directly into heroku database. When I tried to view table in terminal it showed up as a bunch of blank rows, I think because I'm converting the image data into binary. Not sure if there is a way around that, but it's working so it doesn't really matter.
